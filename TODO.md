## Concalls

- The Quarter selection and the Quarter mentioned in the transcript pointing it are not accurate
- Concalls: z-index of dropdown of quarter should it above sticky tabs of Summary, Q&A, etc.
- The custom generation event stream throws an error for the final result.
- Event generation does not stream new content, it waits for entire results to generated and then displayed.
- Add a transcript to automatically include new transcripts from being parsed. You can use LLM to infer if it is indeed an earnings transcript.
- The custom tabs are not visible when the stock changes.
- Include headwinds and tailwinds as cleanly as here: https://kzmj329eqz6rh3mqen2f.lite.vusercontent.net/
- Use some nice custom formatting for each of the default tabs like in https://kzmj329eqz6rh3mqen2f.lite.vusercontent.net/ instead of pure text?
